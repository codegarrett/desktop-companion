SCRIPT 3: "The Technical Flex" (20-30 seconds)
Target: Tech/Maker community
=============================================

[HOOK]
"120 FPS on a two dollar microcontroller."

[BODY]
This little OLED face is running on an ESP32-C3.

[Show smooth animation]

Custom 2D rendering engine. Procedural eye drawing with gradient irises, dynamic pupils, and emotion-driven animations.

[Show scared darting eyes]

The scared animation uses layered sine waves for that nervous energy - no random jitter, just pure math.

[Show birthday mode]

Even built a particle system for these falling stars.

[Quick technical overlay showing: I2C, 128x64, piezo buzzer]

All pushed over I2C to a 128 by 64 monochrome display. With a piezo buzzer for sound effects.

[OUTRO]
Full build guide coming soon. Or not. Depends on how many people actually want it.

=============================================
VISUAL NOTES:
- Screen recordings of smooth animations
- Maybe brief code snippets overlay
- Technical callouts as text overlays
