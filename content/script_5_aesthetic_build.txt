SCRIPT 5: "The Aesthetic Build" (30-45 seconds)
Target: Instagram/YouTube - Cinematic maker content
===================================================

[HOOK - soft, contemplative]
"Sometimes the best projects start with spare parts and a simple question..."

[Slow pan across components]

An ESP32. A tiny OLED screen. A piezo buzzer.

[Show splash screen: "KRG"]

What if I could make something... that feels alive?

[Gentle transition to eyes opening]

Big anime eyes that blink... that look around... that react.

[Montage of emotions - slightly slower, more deliberate]

Happiness. Curiosity. Surprise.

[Show sleepy/sleeping]

Even quiet moments.

[Show scared with context]

And when something's wrong... it shows.

[Birthday mode - let it breathe]

I built this for my kid.

But honestly? 

[Close up of eyes blinking]

I think it was also a little bit for me.

[OUTRO - device on desk, maybe sunset lighting]

Sometimes we all need a friend that just... sits there with us.

===================================================
VISUAL NOTES:
- Soft lighting, shallow depth of field
- Slower transitions, let moments land
- Lo-fi or ambient music underneath
- End card with "Made with love" vibe
