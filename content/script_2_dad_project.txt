SCRIPT 2: "The Dad Project" (30-45 seconds)
Target: YouTube Shorts - Wholesome maker content
===============================================

[HOOK]
"My kid asked for a pet. We compromised."

[BODY]
I found an old ESP32 and a tiny OLED screen in my parts bin, and thought... what if I made something that could keep them company on their desk?

So I built this little guy.

[Show normal blinking]

It blinks. It looks around. It has moods.

[Quick montage: happy, laughing, surprised, sleepy]

Happy. Laughing. Surprised. Even gets a little sleepy.

[Show scared with wiggling]

When it's scared, it actually shakes and looks around nervously. That took way too long to get smooth.

[Show birthday mode]

Oh, and it sings Happy Birthday. With little cakes for eyes. And falling stars.

...I may have gone overboard.

[OUTRO - show full device]
But seeing their face light up? 

Totally worth the three AM debugging sessions.

===============================================
VISUAL NOTES:
- Warm lighting, desk setup visible
- Slow reveals of each emotion
- End with device next to kid's homework/toys
