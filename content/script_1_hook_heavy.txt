=========================================

[HOOK - First 2 seconds]
"Wait... did my desk just get FEELINGS?"

[BODY]
So I had some spare parts lying around and decided to build my kid a little desk companion.

It's got these big anime eyes that actually LOOK at you... blinks... gets happy, scared, even a little crazy sometimes.

[Beat - show scared emotion with darting eyes]

And YES - it plays Happy Birthday. Because obviously.

[SHOW BIRTHDAY MODE with cakes and stars]

Running at 120 frames per second on a tiny two dollar chip. Buttery smooth.

[OUTRO]
Code's on GitHub if you want to build your own. Link in bio.

Part 2 coming if you want to see how it all works.

=========================================
VISUAL NOTES:
- Start with close-up of eyes blinking
- Quick cuts between emotions
