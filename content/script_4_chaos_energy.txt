SCRIPT 4: "Chaos Energy" (15-20 seconds)
Target: TikTok - Fast paced, funny
========================================

[HOOK - rapid fire]
"I made a desk pet and it has MORE emotions than me."

[RAPID CUTS - each emotion 1-2 seconds]

Normal. Fine. Everything's fine.

Happy! Life is good!

LAUGHING - okay calm down.

Surprised - WHO'S THERE?!

[Slower on scared]
Scared... look at those eyes DARTING. It's looking for the threat. The threat is BILLS.

[Birthday mode hits]
AND THEN - BIRTHDAY MODE!

It's got CAKES. FOR EYES. And STARS. FALLING.

[OUTRO]
This is what happens when engineers become parents.

========================================
VISUAL NOTES:
- Very fast cuts, match energy of voiceover
- Zoom ins on eyes during emotions
- Birthday mode gets slightly longer screen time
- Maybe add quick sound effects between cuts
